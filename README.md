Thomas Eakins (1844-1916) is an American late ninetheenth century painter and photographer. In 1876, Eakins painted a portrait of American sculptor William Rush (1756-1833) observing a model as he carves his *Water Nymph and Bittern,* shown below.

One year later, he painted a second version, showing many of the same elements, but very different in several ways.

As a painter, Thomas Eakins is known for his skillful realism and thoughtful storytelling. Throughout his professional career, Eakins worked from life, primarily with subjects from his hometown Philadelphia, PA. This essay will ask *how* he came to these paintings packed with detail and narrative when his subject matter, William Rush, had passed four decades before their conception; it will also explore the *choices* he made for the differences between these two scenes painted one year apart.

#Sketches From Life

Rush's *Water Nymph and Bittern* was originally carved in 1825 for the Fairmount Waterworks.

Curiously, Thomas Eakins produced many paintings and sketches of William Rush's *allegory of the Schuylkill River,* including the sculptor and his model, so it seems evident Rush and his work made a significant impact on Eakins. This sketch to the right shows a gesture drawing of the Nymph and Bittern sculpture from life.

This terra cotta self portrait of William Rush, now at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, was carved in 1822. There are other busts of Rush with a similar furrowed brow, an expression of concentration, which Eakins certainly applied to his own portrait of Rush as he is busy mid-sculpting, as annotated in both paintings.
