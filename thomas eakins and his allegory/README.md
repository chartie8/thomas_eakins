Thomas Eakins (1844-1916) is an American late ninetheenth century painter and photographer. In 1876, Eakins painted a portrait of American sculptor William Rush (1756-1833) observing a model as he carves his *Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River,* shown below.

One year later, he painted a second version, showing many of the same elements, but very different in several ways.

As a painter, Thomas Eakins is known for his skillful realism and thoughtful storytelling. Throughout his professional career, Eakins worked from life, primarily with subjects from his hometown Philadelphia, PA. This essay will ask *how* he came to these paintings packed with detail and narrative when his subject matter, William Rush, had passed four decades before their conception; it will also explore the *choices* he made for the differences between these two scenes painted one year apart.

#Sketched From Life

Rush's *Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River* (also known as *Water Nymph and Bittern*), originally carved in 1825, was one of many monumental sculptures produced for the Fairmount Water Works, Pennsylvania.

Curiously, Thomas Eakins produced many paintings and sketches of William Rush's *allegorical figure of the Schuylkill River,* including the sculptor and his model, so it seems evident Rush and his work made a significant impact on Eakins. This sketch to the right shows a gesture drawing of the Nymph and Bittern sculpture from life.

This terra cotta self portrait of William Rush, now at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, was carved in 1822. There are other busts of Rush with a similar furrowed brow, an expression of concentration, which Eakins certainly applied to his own portrait of Rush as he is busy mid-sculpting, as annotated in both paintings. 

#The Nude Model

In 1866, Thomas Eakins went abroad to France to strengthen his skills in art and enrolled at Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. (*See page 48 in document above.*) Here, he followed a rigid academic tradition, primarily focused on drawing. During these formative years in his education, nude models were readily accessible, which was invaluable to his skill in rendering the human body in dynamic ways. After spending some time in Spain, Eakins returned to Philadelphia in 1870 and found himself hard-pressed to find a nude model, let alone a female. By 1879, as a seasoned drawing professor, the necessity he saw in providing his students a nude model was so important to him that he stirred up a controversy for himself. After repeatedly bringing in fully nude models for his co-ed classes, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts forced him to resign in 1886. This is very important for discussion on Eakinsâ€™ painting of *William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River* and understanding some context behind his choices in this painting and its multiple iterations, as they were created near the height of his teaching career.
