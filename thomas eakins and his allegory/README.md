Thomas Eakins (1844-1916) is an American late ninetheenth century painter and photographer. In 1876, Eakins painted a portrait of American sculptor William Rush (1756-1833) observing a model as he carves his *Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River,* shown below.

One year later, he painted a second version, showing many of the same elements, but very different in several ways.

As a painter, Thomas Eakins is known for his skillful realism and thoughtful storytelling. Throughout his professional career, Eakins worked from life, primarily with subjects from his hometown Philadelphia, PA. This essay will ask how he came to these paintings packed with detail and narrative when his subject matter, William Rush, had passed four decades before their conception; it will also explore the choices he made for some key differences between these two scenes painted one year apart.

#Sketched From Life

Rush's *Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River* (also known as *Water Nymph and Bittern*), originally carved in 1825, was one of many monumental sculptures produced for the Fairmount Water Works in Pennsylvania.

Curiously, Thomas Eakins produced many paintings and sketches of William Rush's *allegorical figure of the Schuylkill River,* including the sculptor and his model, so it seems evident Rush and his work made a significant impact on Eakins. This sketch to the right shows a gesture drawing of the Nymph and Bittern sculpture from life.

This terra cotta self portrait of William Rush, now at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, was carved in 1822. There are other busts of Rush with a similar furrowed brow, an expression of concentration, which Eakins certainly applied to his own portrait of Rush as he raptly chisels away. 

#The Nude Model

In 1866, Thomas Eakins traveled abroad to France and enrolled at Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to strengthen his skills in art. Here, he followed a rigid academic tradition, primarily focused on drawing. (*See page 48 in document above, "The Thomas Eakins Collection", Philladelphia Museum of Art.*) During these formative years in his education, nude models were readily accessible, which was invaluable to his skill in rendering the human body in dynamic ways. After spending some time in Spain, Eakins returned to Philadelphia in 1870 and found himself hard-pressed to find a nude model, let alone a female. By 1879, as a seasoned drawing professor, the necessity he saw in providing his students a nude model was so important to him that he stirred up a controversy for himself. After repeatedly bringing in fully nude models for his co-ed classes, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts forced him to resign in 1886. This experience strongly influences discussion on Eakins’ painting of *William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River* and understanding some context behind his choices in this painting and its multiple iterations, having been created near the height of his teaching career. 

#Masculinity and Femininity

*Homespun* (1881) is a select example of Eakins’ gentle portrayal of the women he has painted from life. The activity of thread spinning is careful yet somewhat mindless, so this gives Eakins the opportunity to show a woman deep in contemplation while using her hands in a creative way.

*The Oboe Player* (1903) is Eakins’ portrait of Dr. Benjamin Sharp, a physician and zoologist engaging in his favorite pastime, playing the oboe. While music is certainly an activity of leisure, Sharp played the oboe professionally with the Philadelphia Symphonic Society. *The Oboe Player* is representative of the individuals Eakins knew closely and admired, whom he enjoyed painting the most. 

#The Chaperone 

.ve-media wc:Eakins,_Thomas_-_The_Agnew_Clinic.jpg left

In this 1889 painting, *The Agnew Clinic*,  Eakins portrays professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Dr. D. Hayes Agnew as he lectures to an auditorium of students. A female subject is shown undergoing a mastecotomy performed by a team of male surgeons. Beside her stands a nurse who maintains a calm and alert posture; she takes the role of the chaperone for the woman in her vulnerable state while an amphitheater full of men gaze at every detail of the procedure. While this is standard practice, the nurse's presence makes the viewer feel more comfortable on the patient's behalf.  

The chaperone is also seen in both iterations of *William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River*. As Rush's model poses naked, the woman is seen knitting in the chair beside her, providing security and support for her. Also note how the seated woman displays Eakins' affinity for the woman lost in contemplative thought, much like in *Homespun*. 

After dissecting *William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River* and breaking it down into a tripartite of themes, what is Thomas Eakins' allegory here? This can possibly be answered by looking at a few sticking points some critics had with this piece--especially the final iteration of 1877. 

Notably, this is a historical painting which depicts a prominent late artist at work and, given the lack of models, largely came out of Eakins' imagination. That being said, it is unlikely that William Rush utilized a nude model to carve his water nymph and bittern sculpture, so it seems that Eakins imposed his own bias for the artful nude onto Rush's artistic process, Rush certainly not having anything to say about it.

Apparently one criticism for this painting was the unattractiveness of the model, for the standards of the time anyway. Given Eakins' experience and exposure, this was likely intentional. Looking at the sculpture, it is virtually impossible to see what the nymph's body would look like under her draped clothing, so Eakins may have taken this opportunity to sculpt his own model, revealing what could possibly exist underneath the fabric folds. 

A significant bone of contention for critics in the 1877 painting is the way the model's clothing is displayed in the foreground of the composition. It's been expressed that the way her garments are splayed over the chair "gives the shock which makes one think about the nudity - and at once the picture becomes improper!" I believe this one artistic decision ties the entire composition and all its themes up with a nice bow, as it communicates perfectly Eakins' admiration for the human body and the eager model, which ought to be enthusiastically accessible to all students of art.
